# Precipitation_Type_Plugin
These files will become the basis for a python package which can be used to calculate precipitation types from pysteps data. The functions can be found in the ptype_functions file. An example juptyer notebook named testing can also be found which can be used to explore the output of the precipitation_type_calculator function. An example file showing how to create a gif and other plots from the output of the precipitation_type_calculator function is currently in development. The file names and package structure will be adjusted in the coming days to move away from the original plan of a pysteps-cookiecutter-plugin towards a standalone package.
