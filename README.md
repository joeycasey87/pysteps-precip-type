# Precipitation_Type_Plugin
 A plugin for the pySTEPS package which calculates the precipitation type of hydrometeors from a combination of pySTEPS and INCA data.

 The script for the plugin itself is found in the importer_rmi.py file. The python files IncaGribImport.py, plots.py, precipitationTypeFields.py,  precipitationType_script.py, and ptype_functions.py are the original precipitation type calculation python files.

 An example script is also included where examples of acceptable input parameters can be seen. (The file paths would have to be changed of course)
